# TODOLIST
This is a command line to do list tool :)

# FEATURES
## CURRENT
the programreads out of a textfile which must be edited manually.
## WORKING ON
Allowing the program to edit the text file itself, so assignments/classes/exams can be added within. 
More menus :) I love menus!!!!
## FUTURE
I will have a makefile to run the progam instead of compiling it.

# HOW TO USE
1. Edit the schedule.txt to add Classes, Assignments, and Exams. 
Format of the text file
```
BEGIN
# CLASS
Example Class
# ASSIGNMENT 
Example Class|Example Assignment|0/0/0|11:59PM
# EXAM

END
```
Class names must match, and must follow the format above with | between text fields. `
